# Project Overview
This project covers all UVA MSDS Online Orientation tasks. This will include 2 main tasks of getting familiar with Jupyter and R and obtaining "badges" as part of the technical orientation. 


# Project Goals
This project can be used to explore and learn the basics of Jupyter and R. It will be useful to build a foundation of these 2 coding languages and to explore different functionalities and capabilities of the 2 languages. The project will include code files for each language separately that cover basic functions, math problems, and plotting methods/creating visuals. This will help show the capability of Jupyter and R and how these languages can be used in lieu of calculators to solve both basic and more complex math problems. I recommend using this project as a starting point to learn about coding differences Jupyter and R and understand their individual nuiances. 

As a note, the coding files for each task will be available in the project/github repo to reference along with useful comments.
